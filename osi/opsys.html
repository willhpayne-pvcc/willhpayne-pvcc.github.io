			<td>Job queue</td>
			<td>A job is the execution of a single program, and a queue is a method of organization based on First In First Out(FIFO). A job queue is a list of jobs to be done based on FIFO order.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>FIFO</td>
			<td>First In First Out is a method of organizing job execution.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Interactive processing</td>
			<td>When a user inputs something into a computer and recieves an output immediatly.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Timesharing</td>
			<td>A computer executing processes for many people at one time.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Multi-processing</td>
			<td>A computer executing many processes for one user.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Application software</td>
			<td>A program that is designed to carry out tasks unrelated to the computers core functions.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>System software</td>
			<td>System software creates a platform for a computer to run other software; and OS is an example of system software.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Utility software</td>
			<td>designed to run diagnostics, maintain the core operations, and aqquire data on how the computer is running. </td>

		<tr>
			<td>Shell</td>
			<td>An older form of UI that used a command window that one could type text prompts in to.</td>

		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Virtual memory</td>
			<td>The memory created on a mass-storage unit via a process called paging. Paging is used when memory needs exceed what is provided in the main memory. The machine stores the data in mass-storage in chunks called pages which then get moved between main mem and storage as needed.</td>
